# Gender-Diversity-in-Tech
Looking at demographics and survey data to find connections between salary and gender proportions at big tech companies.

In this project, I aim to explore diversity in the technology industry. I was drawn to this topic because of my career interest in technology/data science and hope to learn more about the field while applying my data science skill set. I expect to see higher salaries and positions for males as compared to their female counterparts of other races, which tends to be the stereotype of the industry.

Research question: Does company gender proportion differ by annual base pay and/or by state?

The first data set is comprised of survey results from a Hacker News survey of user salaries in the tech industry in 2016, providing detailed job titles, experience years, geographical locations, annual benefits, and signing and stock bonuses from employers. Each row contains a unique survey entry/ participant and there are both numeric and categorical variables.

The second data set is of demographics of the employees from 25 companies in Silicon Valley with data from EEO-1 reports, including gender, race, and job category.

Both data sets were found through Kaggle. I plan to join them using the company names found in each set, called employer_name and company.

Limitations to this analysis include: only male or female is listed as options for gender in EEO-1 reports; the Silicon Valley data is from 2016 while the US census data is from 2013; and I donâ€™t have data on who applied to these companies.
